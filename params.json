The other algorithm used was [Efficient graph based segmentation](http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis research paper is available [here](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/mvg/files/pdf/pdf_16.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis algorithm implementation was ranked **first** on [prague evaluator](http://mosaic.utia.cas.cz/index.php?act=view_res&id=&dyn=0&vis=1&hr=1&sort=2&dir=0&f1=0&f2=-1&f3=-1&f4=-1&ndl=-1&nt=-2&alg=-1&ver=&bid=3&bid=4) in grayscale category. (as on 26 December, 2012).\r\n\r\nThe full [report](https://github.com/rohitgirdhar/TextureSegmentationLBP/blob/master/report.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/rohitgirdhar/TextureSegmentationLBP/blob/master/presentation.pdf?raw=true) is available.\r\n\r\n### To run the code (in matlab)\r\n```\r\ncd TextureSegmentationLBP/src;\r\naddpath('test');\r\nI = imread('image_file_name.jpg');\r\n[S,R,Q] = runIt(I); % runIt implements the full pipeline\r\nimshow(R,[]); %to see the segmentation\r\n```\r\nThe complete results (on prague dataset) are available [here](http://mosaic.utia.cas.cz/index.php?act=res_details&id=&rid=987)"}
